Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment 1

The only script in this repo is labelled "Reading_and_Merging.R". This script completes the following:


1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

The final tidy data set is output to a text named "final_data". This file is included in this repo.

To arrive at this tidy data set you only need to have the UCI HAR Dataset folder in your home directory and then run the "Reading_and_Merging.R" script.

If you want to view the result of task 2 (labeled above) then you only need to view the data frame named "fin_table"
